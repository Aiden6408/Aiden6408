hi there! My name is Aiden and I am currently a student at Boise Codeworks, working through thier Full Stack Development program.In the past I have worked in the healthcare field and  the service industry but left both to find a carreer more suitable to me. I love to continuiously learn and grow and found myself unsatisfied or bored in other jobs and positions. I enjoy the problem solving aspect of software developing and the sense of accomplishment I feel when completeting a project or task. Outside of my professional experience, I enjoy the great out doors but also spend a great deal of time with my children.
